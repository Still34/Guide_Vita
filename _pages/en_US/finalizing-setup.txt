### Required Reading

We will now setup applications and plugins such as the following:    

+  **Vita Homebrew Browser** *(downloads and installs other homebrew applications)*
+  **NoNpDrm** *(allows for encrypted games and applications to be used)*
+  **DownloadEnabler** *(allows any file type to be downloaded with the browser)*
+  **shellbat** *(displays exact battery percentage in the status bar)*
+  **pngshot** *(improves the built-in screenshot utility)*

In order to install the necessary `.vpk` (content package) files on your device, we use the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol) to copy the files to your device's memory card. 

### What You Need

* An FTP Client such as [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/) or [CyberDuck](https://cyberduck.io/)
  + Alternatively, you can also use the USB transfer feature of VitaShell
* [config.txt]({{ "/assets/files/config.txt" | absolute_url }}){:download="config.txt"}
* The latest release of [Vita Homebrew Browser](https://github.com/devnoname120/vhbb/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [NoNpDrm](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/NoNpDrm/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [DownloadEnabler](https://github.com/TheOfficialFloW/DownloadEnabler/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [shellbat](https://github.com/nowrep/vita-shellbat/releases/latest)
* The latest release of [pngshot](https://github.com/xyzz/pngshot/releases/latest)

### Instructions

#### Section I - Prep Work

1. Launch the VitaShell application
1. Press (Start) to open the VitaShell settings

1. Open your FTP client on your computer
1. Enter the IP Address and Port displayed on your device
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:` -> `data/`
  + The `ux0:` partition corresponds to the memory card of your device (on the PS Vita 1000, this partition will always be the external memory card; on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this partition will either be the external memory card if one is inserted, or the built-in memory card otherwise)
  + The `ur0:` partition corresponds to the internal system memory which is always present on all devices (on the PS Vita 2000 and PS TV, this is *not* the same as the built-in memory card!))
1. Transfer `VitaHBBrowser.vpk` to the `data` folder
1. Using your FTP client, navigate to `ux0:` -> `tai/`
1. Transfer `nonpdrm.skprx` to the `tai` folder

1. Press (Circle) on your device to close the FTP connection

#### Section II - Installing VPKs

1. On your device, navigate to `ux0:` -> `data/`
1. Press (Square) on each of the `.vpk` files to mark them
